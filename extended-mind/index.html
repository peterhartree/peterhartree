Pen and paper supplement our working memory. Post-it notes bring things to our attention. Environmental cues trigger automatic patterns of behaviour.</p><p>We all extend our minds in ways like these. I think most people don’t think about this enough.</p><p>You can benefit if you take a considered approach to design, build and refine your extended mind. This post offers a brief survey of the terrain.</p><h3>Why take this perspective?</h3><p>The extended mind perspective encourages us to think in terms of outsourcing cognitive process and function. This helps us develop a coherent strategy for engaging with techniques and tools commonly presented under rubrics of “productivity advice”, “lifehacking” or “metaskills&quot;.</p><p>For the philosophers: the extended mind perspective is a useful model, whether or not you think <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/" target=_blank>functionalism</a> and the <a href=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html target=_blank>extended mind thesis</a> are true in some stronger sense than that.</p><h3>Why care?</h3><p>A good external mind lets you free up scarce internal cognitive resources. With skill (that&#39;s another essay) you can then reallocate these resources to the things that most merit your attention. A good external mind will also improve &quot;your&quot; performance on the surprisingly wide range of tasks which can be partially or fully externalised.</p><p>Humans have been extending their minds using technology for thousands of years. For example:</p><p>[ABACUS] #todo</p><p>Things are getting especially exciting right now, as smartphones, connectivity and cloud services enable powerful new extended mind systems. The utility of a cheap, well designed external mind has significantly increased in the last 10 years, and this upward trend in utility will continue in step with advances in connectivity, artificial intelligence and user interfaces.</p><h3>Designing your extended mind</h3><p>Practical implementations of extended mind systems vary greatly.</p><p>I will refer to the collection of software and hardware that support the system as an extended mind &quot;stack&quot;. The configuration of these components, and the way they relate to each other, I call &quot;architecture&quot;.</p><p>Some desirable qualities for any extended mind system <sup>[1]</sup>:</p><ul><li><em>Low friction</em>: transfer from “internal” to “external” should be cheap and effortless.</li><li><em>Accessible</em>: external resources should always be easily available when needed.</li><li><em>Reliable</em>: external resources should perform as expected and be backed up safely.</li><li><em>Trustworthy</em>: information retrieved from external resources should be more-or-less automatically endorsed. It should be deemed about as trustworthy as something retrieved clearly from biological memory.</li><li><em>Secure</em>: external resources should have robust access control, so that sensitive information can be stored or manipulated externally without hestitation.</li><li><em>Simple</em>: minimise components and interfaces.</li><li><em>Transparent</em>: it should be easy to understand how the system works, to detect failures, and to debug and make changes when necessary.</li></ul><p>In the appendix, I sketch out the major features of my current extended mind system. If you like, you can <a href=#appendix-2>skip to that</a>. For now though, the following table presents a few examples of cognitive functions that are highly susceptible to externalisation:</p><table class=margin-bottom-larger><thead><tr><th style="width: 350px">Cognitive function</th><th>How to externalise</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=section><td colspan=2>Memory</td></tr><tr><td>Working memory</td><td>Temporarily extend your working memory by using throwaway media such as post-it notes, scrap paper, digital documents.</td></tr><tr><td>Task management</td><td>Use cloud-hosted task management software.</td></tr><tr><td>Long term memory</td><td>Use cloud-hosted databases and note taking software.</td></tr><tr class=section><td colspan=2>Attention</td></tr><tr><td>Inbound channels</td><td>Curate and carefully regulate the external channels through which things come to your attention. Use automatic external mechanisms to limit and triage inbound items.</td></tr><tr><td>Prompts</td><td>Configure software that will deliver timely prompts to help you stay focussed on your true priorities. If you need to do something at 4pm tomorrow, instruct your external software to remind you.</td></tr><tr class=section><td colspan=2>Self-awareness</td></tr><tr><td>Journal</td><td>Keep a regular qualitative journal.</td></tr><tr><td>Quantified self</td><td>Measure important variables and store this data externally for periodic review.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The boundary between extended mind and world</h3><p>When should we think of something as part of our extended mind? Are books, for example, part of our long term memory? In their classic paper, Clark and Chalmers (1998) say we should include any part of the world that performs a process which, <em>if it were done in the head</em>, we would call a cognitive process. Since then, more restrictive criteria have been suggested (c.f. Smart (forthcoming), pp.3-4). My preferred rule of thumb is:</p><blockquote><p>if it&#39;s doing something my brain could have done, and it&#39;s normally less than 10 seconds away from my access or control, then it&#39;s part of my extended mind.</p></blockquote><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>A well designed external mind system seems like an increasingly valuable asset. Yet, in 2016, it&#39;s quite difficult for an individual to design and implement such a system. One reason for this is that, right now, the cloud software ecosystem is a mess of (excellent) narrow solutions which must be taped together using connector services and a great deal of trial, error and headscratching. [#todo - expand?]</p><p>To make things better, we&#39;ll have to address some daunting user interface design challenges. As they mature, services like Google Now and Facebook M - AI powered assistants - should help. In the meantime, I&#39;d like to see better sources of advice for individuals who want to build and refine their extended minds using existing tools.</p><p>[1] This list borrows heavily from Clark (2010).</p><p><hr></p><p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on all this.
